# Huffman-Encoding
PROJECT TITLE: HUFFMAN CODING
CONTACT INFORMATION: uzohajekwemm@gmail.com
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Huffman encoding is one of the most popular lossless compression algorithms that works fairly well on any text file. In fact, this algorithm can be applied to any file. It can reduce the storage required by a half or even more in some situations.
AUTHORS: UZOMA OHAJEKWE
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run Huffman.encode(file, encoded file, frequency file) for encoding and Huffman.decode(encoded file, eventual_decoded_file, frequency_file). Take care not to confuse argument files.
