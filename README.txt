PURPOSE: The purpose of this lab is implement a program that can perform basic functionalities with DNA and RNA sequences.  It can transcribe a DNA sequence, copy a sequence, remove sequences, add sequences, edit or shorten sequences, print out sequences in a readable form both for all sequences and for just one sequence. Lab4 represents the fourth lab in the Spring 2019 CSC 172, DNAList represents the idea that biological, DNA and RNA sequences are being manipulated. Sequence.java refers to the class representing sequences that will be put into a list of sequences. Link.java, List.java, LList.java refer to the implementation of a linked list used to create and store the individual characters of a sequence. Refer to the authors for more information
FEATURES: A running move counter calculating the number of moves made is run and displayed along with each valid move. The highest tile created in the game is also displayed at every valid move. Anything text entered will be interpreted by the game and will be printed as either a valid or an invalid move, according to the keys given in the instructions, as well as the actual key entered. Text of greater than two characters will be shortened to the first letter of the text.
